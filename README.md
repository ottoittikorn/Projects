# MyProjects_2025_2026 

## Projects developed by a person with a big passion to make this world a cleaner and better place  

Here are some of my projects that I've been working on, to build my coding/ data analysis, economic and business skills, and also to answer questions that can help solve global issues!! 
I am a self-taught coder and a chemical engineering student, I've combined both skill sets to develop projects such as **"Profit or Planet"** and **"Energy Transition"**. 

There projects were created from my curiosity about the world, and aim to help readers better understand the current energy industries and how are we progressing toward a net-zero or renewable future.

The project **"Energy Transition"** will gives the insight of how the world is progressing witg energy transition. 
The key interesting insight include: 
- Currently the world generate more energy using hydro power than other renewable sources such as wind or solar
- Only 19.6% of global energy generation comes from renewables.
- 83.4% of Brazil’s capacity being renewable compared to just 21.9% in the USA.
- Less than 50% of UK energy generated in 2017 is from fossil fuels sources.
